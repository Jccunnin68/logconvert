-Line 613- -Scene A- Captain Marcus Blaine: [Allaya]  "As I have tried to explain, Captain Blaine, my consciousness was separated from the artificial body when the decision was made to depart.
-Line 614- -Scene C- Cadet Antony: "So your mother was... trill?" *she looked questioning* "and your father was Kzari?
-Line 615- -Scene A- Captain Marcus Blaine: *He rubbed the bridge of his nose a moment.*  "But you still let your body access the gate.
-Line 616- -Scene A- Captain Marcus Blaine: [Allaya]  "Of course I did.  Why wouldn't I trust myself?
-Line 617- -Scene C- Hedwik: "Trill, yes. And well, the kzari part is also a mother. I was a "lab" baby, I suppose you could say." *She nodded.
-Line 618- -Scene C- Hedwik: "They were apparently one of the first openly gay couples back during the Auzherz regime, when it was not quite so accepted. They were a bit of a thorn in the ass of the party, from what I have heard
-Line 619- -Scene C- Cadet Antony: "Oh.. ok, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to assume, just, biologically not something that happens without assistence.  I get it, my mother is a doctor, done things like that for people.
-Line 620- -Scene A- Captain Marcus Blaine: "Maybe because you were in the company of someone who has been kicked out of Starfleet?

-Line 630- -Scene C- Hedwik: *She chuckled.* "Spotted Lynx, I like that.
-Line 631- -Scene C- Cadet Antony: *Tavi is obviously uncomfortable by that question* "She uh, was teaching medicine at the Starfleet Medical Accademy for most of my life.
-Line 632- -Scene C- Ensign Maeve Blaine: "If they wanted you to have a brother that would have been a trick.
-Line 633- -Scene A- Captain Marcus Blaine: "Of course it's not."  *He paused a moment.*  "We'll keep an eye out for her, then.  Are you ready to begin?
-Line 634- -Scene C- Cadet Antony: *laughed at Tolena* "yeah, gene manipulation
-Line 635- -Scene C- Hedwik: *She tilted her head at Tavi, but did not push, before looking to Maeve.* "I do have a brother. Diter. But yes, he came a few years after me, so I imagine it took some work.
